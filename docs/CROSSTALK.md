# Custom Crosstalk Matrices

The **Crosstalk** control in the Process sidebar runs *spectral crosstalk* correction.
NegPy ships with one built-in matrix (**Default**), but you can drop in your own —
calibrated per film stock or scanner — without touching any code.

## What it does

A color negative's three dye layers are not spectrally pure: the cyan, magenta and
yellow dyes each leak a little density into the channels they shouldn't affect. The
result is muddy, low-separation color. Crosstalk correction *unmixes* the channels by
multiplying the per-pixel **negative density** vector by a 3×3 matrix, *before*
normalization and the print curve — the domain the matrices were derived in
(secondary dye absorptions are linear in negative dye density).

The math, per pixel on the raw decoded negative:

```
density      = -log10(rgb_negative)
density_out  = M · density
```

`M` is your 3×3 matrix. The **Crosstalk** slider (0–1) blends it with the identity
matrix and row-normalizes the result, so `0` is off and `1` is the full matrix:

```
M_applied = I · (1 - strength) + M · strength
M_applied = M_applied / row_sums(M_applied)        # each row normalized to sum 1
```

Because every row is renormalized to sum to 1, a uniform gray stays gray — the matrix
only redistributes color *differences* between channels.

## Reading the matrix

The matrix is row-major. **Rows are output channels**, **columns are input channels**:

|            | in R   | in G   | in B   |
| :--------- | :----- | :----- | :----- |
| **out R**  | 1.00   | -0.05  | -0.02  |
| **out G**  | -0.04  | 1.00   | -0.08  |
| **out B**  | -0.01  | -0.10  | 1.00   |

- The **diagonal** stays near `1.0` (each channel keeps its own density).
- **Off-diagonal** terms are usually small and negative — they subtract the
  contamination one layer leaks into another.
- Keep rows roughly summing near `1.0`; large deviations are fine (they get
  normalized) but make the effect harder to reason about.

## File format (TOML)

Put `.toml` files in your user folder:

```
<Documents>/NegPy/crosstalk/
```

On first run NegPy copies the bundled gallery (`crosstalk/` in the repo) here, so
you start with some ready-made profiles. Each file is one matrix:

```toml
# my_film.toml
name = "Kodak Gold 200"        # optional display name; falls back to the filename
matrix = [                     # 3x3, row-major (out R/G/B × in R/G/B)
  [ 1.00, -0.05, -0.02],
  [-0.04,  1.00, -0.08],
  [-0.01, -0.10,  1.00],
]
```

- `matrix` is **required**: exactly 3 rows of 3 numbers.
- `name` is **optional**. If omitted, the dropdown shows the filename (without `.toml`).
- Malformed files (wrong shape, non-numbers, bad TOML) are silently skipped.
- The name `Default` is reserved for the built-in matrix and ignored if reused.

The chosen matrix is **baked into the edit** when you select it, so saved edits and
presets stay reproducible even if you later move or delete the file.

## Using it

1. Drop your `.toml` into `<Documents>/NegPy/crosstalk/`.
2. Open the **Process** sidebar → the **crosstalk dropdown** under CROSSTALK. New files
   appear the next time the panel syncs (e.g. switching photos); restart if you don't see it.
3. Pick your profile and raise **Crosstalk** above 0 to apply it.
4. Pick **Default** to revert to the built-in matrix.

### Editing matrices in the app

The **sliders icon** next to the dropdown opens the **matrix editor**, so you don't
have to hand-edit TOML:

- Browse every profile — bundled matrices (and **Default**) show a lock and are
  **read-only**; your own profiles are editable.
- Drag the off-diagonal grid sliders (`out R/G/B` × `in R/G/B`) and the preview updates
  live. The diagonal is fixed — the matrix is row-normalized on apply, which makes the
  diagonal redundant, so only the six mixing terms are editable. The **Preview strength**
  slider only controls how strongly the matrix previews here — it's view-only; use the
  sidebar **Separation** slider to actually apply it.
- **Calibrate from chart…** derives a brand-new profile from a photo of a **SpyderCheckr**
  colour chart instead of a datasheet. Open the chart as the current photo, then drag a box
  over each patch and tag it (the six primaries R/G/B/C/M/Y; black/white/grey help). **Solve**
  then optimizes the matrix *against the rendered result* — it renders the chart through the
  pipeline many times, minimizing the colour error of the rendered patches versus the
  SpyderCheckr's published values (takes ~a minute; cancellable). Because it targets the final
  image rather than a density-domain proxy, it reliably matches or beats a hand-tuned matrix.
  Name it and save — it lands in the list like any other profile. It still only corrects what
  a 3×3 unmix can (hue/separation), not tone.
- **Make Editable Copy** clones the selected (locked) matrix into an editable profile.
- **Save** writes the profile as a `.toml` into `<Documents>/NegPy/crosstalk/` — the same
  folder profiles are read from — so it shows up in the dropdown.
- **Apply & Close** keeps what you were previewing; **Cancel** reverts.

> Crosstalk is a color operation and is hidden in B&W mode. Because it changes what
> the normalization meters read, re-run **Batch Analysis** (and re-save locked bounds)
> after changing the profile or strength.

## Contributing a matrix

Calibrated a film stock or scanner? Add your `.toml` to the repo's
[`crosstalk/`](../crosstalk/) folder and open a PR — bundled matrices ship to all
users on the next release. See [`crosstalk/README.md`](../crosstalk/README.md).
